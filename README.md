## 📖 Introduction

The **Job Shared Library** is a core component of the **Job Vacancies Platform**. It encapsulates the shared logic, data structures, and domain entities used across the ecosystem, specifically by the **Job App** (Candidate Portal) and **Job Backoffice** (Admin Dashboard).

By centralizing these definitions, we ensure consistency, reduce code duplication, and simplify maintenance across the micro-services.

## 📂 Project Structure

This library primarily manages:

### 1. Eloquent Models
The definitive source of truth for database entities:
- **`User`**: Authentication and role management.
- **`Company`**: Employer profiles and data.
- **`JobVacancy`**: Job listings and details.
- **`JobCategory`**: Classification of jobs.
- **`JobApplication`**: Candidates' applications to specific jobs.
- **`Resume`**: Meta-data for candidate resumes.

### 2. Enums
Strictly typed enumerations to ensure data integrity:
- **`UserRole`**: Admin, Company Owner, Candidate.
- **`JobStatus`**: Active, Closed, Draft.
- **`JobType`**: Full-time, Remote, Contract, etc.
- **`ApplicationStatus`**: Pending, Reviewed, Rejected, Hired.

- **Role**: admin (Super User)
- **Email**: admin@admin.com
- **Password**: 12345678

> **Warning:** Do **not** use these default credentials in production. Change the admin password immediately after first login.
